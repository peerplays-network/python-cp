python-cp stands for Pyhton Couch Potato
This project is part of peerplays block chain tech catering sports feed for bos-auto. 
The purpose of this project is to develop a mechanism for gathering information about sporting events collectively.

The code is expected to run in a server/machine with a fixed IP so that witnesses can enable access to those specific python-cp servers.

python-cp is a command line interface for couch potatos to update sporting events to peerplays witnesses running bos-auto.

The project repo is maintained at `Peerplays Gitlab Repo <git@gitlab.com:PBSA/PeerplaysIO/tools-libs/python-cp.git>`
